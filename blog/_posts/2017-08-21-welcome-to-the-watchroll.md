Welcome, this is a blog about my watch collection. I try to document the watches that I own and I want to own in the future.

Every watch collector has an on going watch hit list. It never ends.

I am looking forward to start documenting this journey and all of it will live in here. A special place where I can go and share all my thoughts about watches.

In the meantime, here's my favourite watch video series: Talking Watches. Watch one video, or watch all of them.
